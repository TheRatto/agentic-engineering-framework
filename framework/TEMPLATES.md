## Runbooks (Optional)

Runbooks are execution aids generated by the Planner for specific features.
They provide copy/paste-ready agent prompts but do not replace the authoritative workflow.

- **RUNBOOK_SCHEMA.md** — structure for per-feature runbooks
- **RUNBOOKS_GUIDE.md** — guidance on when and how to use runbooks

---

## Artefact Schemas

The following schemas define the expected structure for project artefacts.
They are reference templates only and do not contain project-specific data.

### Planning & Status
- **PROJECT_BRIEF_SCHEMA.md**
- **PRD_GUIDE.md**
- **FEATURES_SCHEMA.md**
- **STATUS_SCHEMA.md**
- **CHANGELOG_SCHEMA.md**
- **UI_SPEC_SCHEMA.md**

### Architecture
- **ADR_SCHEMA.md**

### Security
- **SECURITY_REVIEW_SCHEMA.md**

Schemas should be referenced by agents when generating artefacts, but not duplicated.

## Execution Helpers

- **FEATURE_RUNNER.md**  
  Optional helper for sequencing feature execution steps. Not a source of truth.
